# Peer Learning Activity 

Develop by Caroline Parslow, Xinzhao Li, Larry Li for Dr. Peter Halpin at UNC-Chapel Hill.


## 0. Peer Learning in the Time of COVID-19
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, students have been mostly participating in remote courses and losing a lot of opportunities to enjoy face-to-face classroom activities, the variety of which ranging from group discussions to worksheet collaborations. 
The project, born out of such observation, aims to be the pilot of online synchronous activities built for college students, allowing them to cooperate remotely and re-enjoy the precious face-to-face experience lacking in "video classrooms."
Throughout the process of the activity, students are given an interactive map based on COVID-19 statictics and they are asked to take turns to collect information and cooperate through chats to answer a set of questions.
Besides providing face-to-face experience, it also allows instructors to observe how well the students collaborate.

    ```
    npx generate-react-cli component MyComponent
    ```

    , in which "MyComponent" is the name of your choice. This will generate the .js file, .css file, and testing file together for the component.
Related configurations can be found in the file generate-react-cli.json.
